# Hote Booking

In this program the use can check a list of Hotels, book rooms and reserv tickets. 

## Description

This program does not have any User interface, we are using CLI. First the user inputs the name of the Hotel, then he gets asked about the paying method and at the end signs a document with his data so he gets a receipt. 

## Uses
This programa uses OOP to create a set of classes that are called during the program and ask for differente variables. The objetctive of the app is to show to the user that he is booking an hotel.

### What changes
This program has two CSV documents that compare and update that Data during the programs run time. 

# What needs to be done

This program needs acces to an API of Hotels so we dont have to use custom CSV documents for the DataFrames and we should get the Credit card information from other places.
